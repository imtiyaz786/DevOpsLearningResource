This repository contains DevOps learning material. As I progress with my DevOps journey, I will be updating this repo.
I have been referring to YouTube videos for learning and so far it's going good.

YouTube playlists worth referring for embarking on DevOps journey:
1.Technical Guftgu: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBGx66SQNZ8aPsFDwb79JrS2KQBTIZo10
2.DevOps bootcamp by Kunal Kushwaha: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9gnSGHSqcnoqBXdMwUTRod4Gi3eac2Ak
