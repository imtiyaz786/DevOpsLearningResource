What is Ansible?

#Configuration Management Tool(push-based)
#Infrastructure as a Code(IAC) tool
#Uses YAML for scripting which is nothing but key value pair.
#YAML --> Yet Another Programming Language.
#It is open-source IT configuration management, deployment and orchestration tool.
#Aims to provide large productivity gains to a wide variety of automation challenges

#Acquired by RedHat in 2015
#Available for RHEL, Debian, CentOS, Oracle Linux, etc.

Features:
#Can be used whether we work on on-premises or cloud servers.
#It turns code into infrastructure that means your computing environment has somewhat same attributes
