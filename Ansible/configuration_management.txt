Configuration Management
_____________________________
It's a method of automating configuration related tasks like installing, updating, initializing, etc.
Configuration: each and every minute detail of your machine(server, storage).
Management: Create, Delete or Update, etc.

Before Automation
_________________

#System Administrator used to manage all the servers and do the configuration manually.
#It required manual efforts, overhead to manage large number of servers.
#Hence, it was time-consuming and had high margin of errors with reduced efficiency.

After Automation
________________
We now have configuration management tools available in the market which are of two types: 
1.Push based configuration: Push based configuration server pushes configuration to all  the nodes connected to it.
#It has more control and is easier to implement.
eg. Ansible, Salt Stac

2.Pull based configuration: Pull-based configured nodes check with the server periodically and fetches the configuration from it.
# Specifically used when new machine needs to be configured or initialized.
eg. Chef, Puppet.

Infrastucture as Code (IaC) means creating or building infrastructure using code. Thus, configuration management tool can also be termed as IAC tool.

# It turns code into infrastructure.
# code would be repeatable, testable, and versionable

Advantage:

-> Complete Automation
-> Increase UpTime
-> Improve Performance
-> Ensure Compliance
-> Prevent Errors
-> Reduce Cost.

#Configuration Management is part of operation in DevOps.
